<p>I always intend to write something here, but instead I always end up writing code instead of prose.
<br/> In the meantime, I'll give a list of my interests and the things I like. That should give a pretty good view on who I am.
<h1>Things I like</h1>

<div style="margin-left : auto; margin-right: auto; max-width : 980px;">
<div class="row" style="text-align: justify ">
	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">Film</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">I really enjoy watching a great movie. A great movie is a movie that makes you think differently about something. That doesn't necessarly mean it can't be a blockbuster though.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">Vim</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px"><a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> is my preferred text editor/ide. It took me a while to get productive with it. But now it would be hard to work without it. With the right plugins you can get a very usable and customizable development enviroment. Only for debugging and java I tend to use eclipse. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">Drupal</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px"><a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>
		is probably one of the best content management systems. But it's an even better example of a successfull open source project. It shows that if people/individuals collaborate as a community, they can deliver a superior product. In my opinion the world would be a better place if it worked more like Drupal.

<div class="row" style="text-align: justify">
	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">Dinghy Sailing</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">It's wet, it's cold, it's exhausting but everytime when there's a nice breeze, I long to go out sailing. Sadly it's an expensive sport, so I only do it a few times a year. Almost exclusively at the French sailing school <a href='http://www.glenans.asso.fr/'>Les gl√©nans</a> 		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">Hadoop</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">
		Just like Drupal, another great open source project ( though very different in many ways ). I worked with Hadoop during my masterthesis and while it was often frustrating as it limits you in many ways, it still is a very powerful technology which is shown by the adoption by some very big companies. A bright future ahead!

	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">A Challenge</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">Working on difficult things can be frustrating, easy things however are in most cases just boring. I try to take the easy way not too often. But that on itself can already be a challenge :-)</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row" style="text-align: justify">
	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">Japan</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">
		One of the most intriguing and versatile countries i've visited untill now. The memories I have about my internship in Tokyo and my travels afterwards are still very vivid. I'll certainly go back, but unfortunately you can't just walk there.

	<div class="span3">
		<h2 style="font-weight : 400">More</h2>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">
		There's definitely more, check back later!
