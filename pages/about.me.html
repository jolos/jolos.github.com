		<p>
		Let's try to keep this concise :<br/><br/>
		I'm Joris Geessels, Jolos is the pseudonym I use on the net since the age of ~15. I graduated as a computer science engineer
		from the <a href='https://ugent.be'>University of Ghent</a>. As an engineer i'm interested in everything that concerns building stuff. But currently my main focus is on building stuff for the web. Mostly backend stuff but I try to keep track of evolutions at the client side as well.

		<p>
			I'm working as a software engineer at the <a href="http://photonics.intec.ugent.be/">photonics research group</a> (University of Ghent). Where i'm working on <a href="http://www.ipkiss.be">ipkiss</a> and <a href="http://www.caphesim.com">caphe</a>.

		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Film</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">I really enjoy watching a great movie. A great movie is a movie that makes you think differently about something. That doesn't necessarly mean it can't be a blockbuster though.</p>

		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Technology and Computing</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">Day in day out I'm working with computers, I think it's a very interesting field with a lot of things happening and evolving very quickly. This also makes it a challenging field to work in as it takes a lot of effort to keep yourself up to date. </p>

		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Dinghy Sailing</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">It's wet, it's cold, it's exhausting but everytime when there's a nice breeze, I long to go out sailing. Sadly it's an expensive sport, so I only do it a few times a year. Almost exclusively at the French sailing school <a href='http://www.glenans.asso.fr/'>Les gl√©nans</a> 		</p>

		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">A Challenge</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">Working on difficult things can be frustrating, easy things however are in most cases just boring. I try to take the easy way not too often. But that on itself can already be a challenge :-)</p>

		<p style="margin-left : 10px">
		One of the most intriguing and versatile countries i've visited untill now. The memories I have about my internship in Tokyo and my travels afterwards are still very vivid. I'll certainly go back, but unfortunately you can't just walk there.
