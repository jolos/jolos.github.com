		<p>
		Let's try to keep this concise :<br/><br/>
		I'm Joris Geessels, Jolos is the pseudonym I use on the net since the age of ~15. I graduated as a computer science engineer
		from the <a href='https://ugent.be'>University of Ghent</a>. As an engineer i'm interested in everything that concerns building stuff. But my main focus is on building stuff for the web. Mostly backend stuff but I try to keep track of evolutions at the client side as well.

		<h3 style="font-weight: 400">Stuff I like:</h3>
		<p> Some of the subjects & technologies I like </p>
	</div>
	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Film</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">I really enjoy watching a great movie. A great movie is a movie that makes you think differently about something. That doesn't necessarly mean it can't be a blockbuster though.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Vim</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px"><a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> is my preferred text editor/ide. It took me a while to get productive with it. But now it would be hard to work without it. With the right plugins you can get a very usable and customizable development enviroment. Only for debugging and java I tend to use eclipse. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Drupal</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px"><a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>
		is probably one of the best content management systems. But it's an even better example of a successfull open source project. It shows that if people/individuals collaborate as a community, they can deliver a superior product. In my opinion the world would be a better place if it worked more like Drupal.

	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Dinghy Sailing</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">It's wet, it's cold, it's exhausting but everytime when there's a nice breeze, I long to go out sailing. Sadly it's an expensive sport, so I only do it a few times a year. Almost exclusively at the French sailing school <a href='http://www.glenans.asso.fr/'>Les gl√©nans</a> 		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Hadoop</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">
		Just like Drupal, another great open source project ( though very different in many ways ). I worked with Hadoop during my masterthesis and while it was often frustrating as it limits you in many ways, it still is a very powerful technology which is shown by the adoption by some very big companies. A bright future ahead!

	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">A Challenge</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">Working on difficult things can be frustrating, easy things however are in most cases just boring. I try to take the easy way not too often. But that on itself can already be a challenge :-)</p>

	<div class="four columns">
		<h4 style="font-weight : 400">Japan</h4>
		<p style="margin-left : 10px">
		One of the most intriguing and versatile countries i've visited untill now. The memories I have about my internship in Tokyo and my travels afterwards are still very vivid. I'll certainly go back, but unfortunately you can't just walk there.
